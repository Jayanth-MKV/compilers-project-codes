The actual cpp file is ll.cpp

hence run : make     (g++ ll1.cpp && ./a.out input.txt)

then we get ll file 

The input.txt contains the grammar which is to be given as input.

Now run  "  ./ll input.txt   "

Next it prompts to enter the string to validate if the grammar is LL1.

After entering the string, the dot file automatically generates and opens.

ex: 

The Grammar is LL1 Accepted

the grammar in input file is :   S ->  aSb  |   c

Enter the string to check for the above Grammar

--> Entered string is ' aacbb ' here.

It displays whether the string is accepted or not

if accepted then,
g.dot is generated 
and output.svg is generated and opened.
